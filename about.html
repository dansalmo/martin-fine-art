      <h2>Philosohy and Vision</h2>
      <h3>Core</h3>
      <p>It is the core belief of Martin Fine Art Classes that anyone can learn to draw and paint skillfully, given the right instruction. This core belief is what drives the instructional approach for both children and adults and makes Martin Fine Art Classes unique in comparison to other art schools or drop-in arts and crafts programs.</p>

      <p>Martin Fine Art Classes uses the approach that has been in existence for hundreds of years, the old masters’ approach. This &#8220;atelier&#8221; approach is then made unique in that the concepts and skills are broken down in easy to understand terms so that students focus on mastering a skill or idea before moving on to another. Each skill and/or concept builds upon the other and is taught in a sequence such that the student does not feel overwhelmed and frustrated, wanting to give up because they are not “talented.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>The vision of Martin Fine Art Classes is that students of all ages will be able to freely create high quality works of art in order to enrich their lives and the lives of those around them, develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world and aesthetics, as well as influence career choices and opportunities.</p>

      <h3>Founders</h3>
      <p>Martin Fine Art Classes is founded by Albert and Laura Martin. Albert Martin has an extensive background of over twenty years teaching in the public and private setting. A successful artist himself, Albert Martin’s paintings are in private collections throughout California. Mr. Martin always enjoyed drawing and painting as a child. He started to seriously study art in his late teens with renowned artist and art instructor Larry Gluck at his art studios in Los Angeles, California. There he learned the traditional techniques of the old masters and how to teach these techniques in a way that any individual could understand the fundamentals of how to draw and paint. Mr. Martin instructed drawing and painting in private school settings for several years. He then entered public education teaching at the high school level as well as public school administration. Mr. Martin holds a Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics and a Master of Arts degree in Educational Leadership as well as being fully credentialed to teach in the California public school system.</p>

      <p>Laura Martin has an extensive background in education. She is currently a counselor at a local middle school. Laura has taught in elementary and middle school settings for the past 20 years. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education and a Master of Science in Counseling.</p>

      <p>The Martins and their two elementary school age daughters reside in Carlsbad, California.</p>
