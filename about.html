      <h2>Philosohy and Vision</h2>
      <h3>Core</h3>
      <p>It is the core belief of Martin Fine Art Classes that anyone can learn to draw and paint skillfully, given the right instruction. This core belief is what drives the instructional approach for both children and adults and makes Martin Fine Art Classes unique in comparison to other art schools or drop-in arts and crafts programs.</p>

      <p>Martin Fine Art Classes uses the approach that has been in existence for hundreds of years, the old masters’ approach. This &#8220;atelier&#8221; approach is then made unique in that the concepts and skills are broken down in easy to understand terms so that students focus on mastering a skill or idea before moving on to another. Each skill and/or concept builds upon the other and is taught in a sequence such that the student does not feel overwhelmed and frustrated, wanting to give up because they are not “talented.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>The vision of Martin Fine Art Classes is that students of all ages will be able to freely create high quality works of art in order to enrich their lives and the lives of those around them, develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world and aesthetics, as well as influence career choices and opportunities.</p>
