<h2>School-Age Children</h2>
<p>The goal of the MFAC Young Masters Program is to teach children ages 6 and above the necessary mechanical and observational skills necessary for them to create high quality representational fine art. Martin Fine Art Classes emphasizes <strong>mastery of&nbsp;foundational and advanced skills</strong>.&nbsp;It is also a goal of the program that through creating representational fine art students will enrich their lives and the lives of those around them while developing an appreciation for aesthetics and the beauty of the natural world. Finally, while attending Martin Fine Art Classes we want your child to be engaged, interested, and having fun!</p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<h3>Line Drawing</h3>
<p>Students will first learn to draw anything with confidence. Students ages 5-7 will begin in Level I and 8-12 begin in Level II. This initial stage is the “learning to see” stage. They will learn to sketch while simultaneously observing the subject matter and to correct size, placement, and proportion of initial sketches through the use of learned concepts and perceptual tools to develop a final drawing. Students will then add pastel color and shading.</p>

<h3>Acrylic Painting</h3>
<p>Level I Students will apply knowledge and skills gained in the Level I drawing to the use of Acrylic paints. Students will learn the basic techniques and styles of painting while completing a variety of paintings including landscape, seascape, animals, and still life, including the duplication of recognized works of art. Students will also learn how to handle and care for painting materials.</p>

<h3>Value Drawings in Charcoal</h3>
<p>Working primarily from still life Level II students will learn the key principles for creating three dimensions on a two dimensional surface. Building on prior knowledge developed during line drawing, students will work with vine charcoal on charcoal paper to apply the key concepts in developing the entire range of value in a drawing in order to create the illusion of three dimensions.</p>

<h3>Oil Painting</h3>
<p>Students will apply knowledge and skills gained in Level II drawing and value drawing or acrylic and watercolor to the use of oil paints. Initially students will paint two to three monochromatic paintings after which they will learn color mixing and color theory.</p>
<p>Students will produce a variety of oil paintings including the duplication of recognized works of art by the old masters and impressionist. Students will learn a variety of techniques and styles while painting in oils.</p>

<h3>Watercolor</h3>
<p>Following oil painting, students will work in watercolor applying their prior knowledge to this new medium by completing a variety of watercolor paintings including landscape, seascape, animals, and still life. Students will progress through the following</p>
<ul>
    <li>Familiarization with materials</li>
    <li>Washes (flat, graduated, within and around an object)</li>
    <li>Edges</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in either program work at their own pace according to their own ability level through <strong>individualized</strong> instruction which takes each students' unique abilities and interests into consideration. As a result, each student receives a "customized" approach to learning drawing and painting skills, while gaining patience, the ability to focus, and pride and confidence in their work. Depending on dexterity students will work from still-life, landscape, animals, and duplicating recognized works of art. The Martin Fine Art Classes Young Masters Program aligns with the California State Standards for Visual Arts.</p>
